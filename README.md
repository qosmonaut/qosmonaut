Hi, I'm Alen! Welcome to my GitHub Profile, feel free to explore.

I'm an engineer with 7+ years of experience working in regulated medtech environments, from start-ups to multinationals. I design, build and maintain robust, full-stack software and data platforms aligned with business needs. My goal is to apply my systems engineering skills to create data-driven solutions that work for the benefit of both patients and healthcare providers.
